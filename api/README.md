# REST API - Techdegree Project 10

## Project Description

In this project, I create a REST API with express. The purpose of the REST API is to help administer a school database containing information about courses and users. Users can interact with the database by performing CRUD operations to CREATE, READ, EDIT, and DELETE courses in the database if they authenticated with the database.
