# Treehouse Techdegree - Project 10 

## Full-Stack-App with REST API for school database

In this project, I use React to create client for an existing school database that I create 
for [project 9](https://github.com/kervcode/REST-API). 

## Features
- use basic authentication to allow users to sign up and sign in
- Allow users to interact with the database to retrieve a list of courses, 
- Allow all users to view details for each course.
- Allow authenticated user to update and delete course they own.
